# Password_Protected_Application
It is an under development  app created  to save people from awkard circumstances when we have to show our phone to someone right at that time and we are browsing or accessing some private things so this is an applock which allows you to setup 2 passwords . One to open the app and other to show error that , so normally person will use the 1st password and in some rare circumstances when we have to show our phone when  we dont want to show the person will enter the second password which will show a popup message that your app ran in to an error please exit. Which will help to get enough time to get rid of the problem.
